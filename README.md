In this code, I am looking at the characteristics of companies, businesses, business owners, and technology use in businesses. 

Unfortunately, without access to the API, it is difficult to interpret the data. For this reason, I focused solely on owners for my two visualizations.

I will create more visualizations once I recieve the API and have more access to searching the dataset.

![Bar graph of owners by race](cleaner_race_owner.png "Owners by Race") 

Here is a bar chart that shows the breakdown of owners by different races.


![Pie chart of owners by gender](gender-owner.png "Owners by Gender")

Here is a pie chart that shows the breakdown of owners by gender.

![Pie chart of business employees by gender](gender-business.png "Employees by Gender")

This is a pie chart that breaks down business employess by gender.

Here is the Census Business [data](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/abs.2019.html) that I used for this project.
